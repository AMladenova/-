Task 3. Write down the NETWORK address using the ANDing operation.

IP Address: 172.16.145.29
Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0
Network Address: 172.16.145.0/16 

IP Address: 192.168.10.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Network Address: 192.168.10.0/24 

IP Address: 192.168.68.210
Subnet Mask:255.255.255.128
Network Address: 192.168.68.0/25

IP Address: 172.16.188.15
Subnet Mask: 255.255.240.0
Network Address: 172.16.188.0/20

IP Address: 10.172.2.8
Subnet Mask: 255.224.0.0
Network Address: 10.172.2.0/11

Task 4. Determine whether IP addresses are on the same network.

PC-A is given IP address: 192.168.1.18
PC-B is given IP address: 192.168.1.33
Both PCs have subnet mask 255.255.255.240

What is the network address for PC-A and PC-B? 192.168.1.0/28
